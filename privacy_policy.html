Privacy Policy

Adrian McPhee built the Two Player Chess app as a Commercial app. 

This service is provided by Adrian McPhee through the Google Play and 
Apple App stores and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the 
collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information.

Information Collection and Use

The application is designed to run locally, including without an internet 
connection. However, Google analytics / Firebase and Facebook analytics are 
included in the application to ensure issues can be identified and that paid 
marketing campaigns can be optimised.  The free version of the app uses 
Google AdMob for ad placement.

Please consult the privacy policies of the third-party services mentioned if 
you are curious or have concerns.

Changes to This Privacy Policy

I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to 
review this page periodically for any changes.

This policy is effective as of 2020-10-24
