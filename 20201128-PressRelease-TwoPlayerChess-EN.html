Does the iPad make the traditional chessboard redundant?

HEEMSTEDE, 28 November 2020 - Netflix-series "The Queen's Gambit" is a gigantic
success and is now the best watched miniseries on Netflix. The miniseries about
a young chess talent even caused a worldwide run on chess boards. Since a few
weeks there is also the possibility to turn a smartphone or tablet into a chess
board. Entrepreneur Adrian McPhee developed “Two Player Chess”, a symmetrical
digital chessboard with which you always have a chessboard nearby.

When using a phone or tablet as a chessboard, traditional 2D chess piece
designs are upside down for one player.  This means that it has not been
possible to effectively play chess with two people face to face on an iPad.
This caused Adrian McPhee, a chess player himself, to develop "Two Player
Chess" a symmetrical digital chess board app for mobile and tablet devices.
With the unique symmetrical design, players of Two Player Chess both see the
same board, just as with a traditional chessboard.  With Two Player Chess every
smartphone or tablet can be turned into a chessboard, meaning you always have a
chessboard with you.

Adrian got the idea for Two Player Chess a few years ago, when during a holiday
he discovered that he couldn’t find an app that would turn his iPad into a
chessboard for two. During the first Corona lockdown he decided to develop his
idea into an application, with the thought that during this time more people
would want to play boardgames. The release of Two Player Chess in September was
timed perfectly by coincidence with the release of the successful Netflix:
"Friends and colleagues are asking me if I had knowledge about the Netflix
release calendar!" Adrian says.

Whether a digital chessboard makes the traditional chessboard redundant remains
to be seen. It is a fact that Two Player Chess can be an alternative for
starting chess players who have a smartphone or tablet and are on the fence
about buying a chess set, and features in Two Player Chess such as the
highlighting of legal moves can help to teach chess to younger generations. For
others, Two Player Chess is a great addition to the traditional chess board,
because it offers the possibility to play chess anytime and anywhere. Two
Player Chess can be downloaded for free via the Apple App Store and the Google
Play Store. Links are provided at twoplayerchess.com
